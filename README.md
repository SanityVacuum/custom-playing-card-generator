# CustomPlayingCards
A simple web tool to create a 4 or 5 suit deck of playing cards that allows the user to substitute their own  suits (pips), face cards (courts), and jokers/wildcards, by either selecting from a library folder or uploading their own.  They can then modify the size of the courts and download a .zip file with 52-72 cards, or send directly to a printer
